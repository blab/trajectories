# Trajectories

This is a simple repo to provision evolutionary sequence trajectories from Nextstrain trees

# Installation

Install various dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Workflow

The workflow is managed through Snakemake. To run the entire workflow:

```
snakemake --cores 1 -p
```

## Dataset-specific outputs

To provision specific datasets, use the `target_analyses` config:
```
# Provision spike dataset only
snakemake --cores 1 -p --config target_analyses='["spike"]'

# Provision multiple datasets
snakemake --cores 1 -p --config target_analyses='["spike","cytb"]'
```

## Available datasets

The following datasets are pre-configured and can be used with the above commands:

- `spike`: [SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 sequences](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/cov-diffusion/10k/2025-09-15) (10,195 sequences x 2055 nucleotides)
- `cytb`: [Mammalian cytochrome B sequences](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/cytb) (5059 sequences x 1140 nucleotides)
- `n450`: [Measles N450 sequences](https://nextstrain.org/measles/N450@2025-10-01) (2429 sequences x 450 nucleotides)
