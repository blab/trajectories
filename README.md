# Trajectories

This is a simple repo to provision evolutionary sequence trajectories from Nextstrain trees

# Installation

Install various dependencies with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Workflow

The workflow is managed through Snakemake. To run the entire workflow:

```
snakemake --cores 1 -p
```

## Dataset-specific outputs

To provision specific datasets, use the `target_analyses` config:
```
# Provision spike dataset only
snakemake --cores 1 -p --config target_analyses='["spike-xs"]'

# Provision multiple datasets
snakemake --cores 1 -p --config target_analyses='["spike-xs","cytb-xs"]'
```

## Available datasets

The following datasets are pre-configured and can be used with the above commands:

- `spike-xs`: [SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 sequences](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/cov-diffusion/10k/2025-09-15) (10,195 sequences x 2055 nucleotides)
- `cytb-xs`: [Mammalian cytochrome B sequences](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/cytb) (5059 sequences x 1140 nucleotides)
- `n450-xs`: [Measles N450 sequences](https://nextstrain.org/measles/N450@2025-10-01) (2429 sequences x 450 nucleotides)

Dataset names include a size suffix indicating the number of tips:
- `xs`: 1k - 10k tips
- `sm`: 10k - 100k tips
- `md`: 100k - 1M tips
- `lg`: 1M - 10M tips

## S3 upload

Results can be uploaded to an S3 bucket using the `upload` target:

```
snakemake --cores 1 -p upload
```

This uploads `results/` to `s3://{bucket}/trajectories/`. Requires `S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables to be set.

# Outputs

## Intermediate data files

For each dataset, the workflow generates intermediate files in `data/{dataset}/`:

- `auspice.json` - Original Nextstrain tree data
- `alignment.fasta` - Sequences for all nodes (tips and internal)
- `metadata.tsv` - Phylogenetic metadata with parent relationships
- `branches.tsv` - Parent-child relationships with Hamming distances

## Trajectory files

The main output is one trajectory file per tip in `results/{dataset}/`:

```
results/
├── spike-xs/
│   ├── USACA-CDC-STM-A1234562021.fasta.zst
│   ├── NigeriaISTH-E02312020.fasta.zst
│   └── ...
├── cytb-xs/
│   └── ...
└── n450-xs/
    └── ...
```

Each trajectory is a zstd-compressed FASTA file containing the evolutionary path from root to tip:

```
>NODE_0000000|0
ATGTTCGTTTTT...
>NODE_0001234|15
ATGTTCGTTTTT...
>TipName|42
ATGTTCGTTTTT...
```

Where each header contains `>{node_name}|{cumulative_hamming_distance}`. Intermediate nodes with zero mutations are skipped (root and tip are always included).

## Summary statistics

A consolidated `results/summary.json` file contains statistics for all processed datasets:

```json
{
  "cytb-xs": {
    "url": "nextstrain.org/groups/blab/cytb",
    "num_tips": 5059,
    "num_nodes": 10117,
    "sequence_length": 1140,
    "hamming_from_root": { "min": 154, "max": 602, "mean": 377.81 },
    "path_depth": { "min": 6, "max": 43, "mean": 22.28 },
    "total_branches": 10116,
    "zero_distance_branches": 373,
    "per_branch_hamming": { "min": 0, "max": 253, "mean": 29.24 }
  },
  "spike-xs": { ... },
  "n450-xs": { ... }
}
```

Each dataset entry is added or updated when its trajectories are generated.
